# React_ToDo-SPA
## ToDo app on MERN stack


### How to run:

First of all you need to have MongoDB Url.
One of the options:
1) sign up for https://www.mongodb.com/;
2) create your cluster;
3) copy url.
Then paste your Url to file "default.json" in folder "config" in place "<paste your MongoDB URL>".
Also paste your Url to file "app.json" in place "<paste your MongoDB URL>".

Assuming you'll have Node.js already installed, go with following steps to get the app working:
1) In project directory: Run `npm install`;
2) In "client" folder: Run `npm install`;
3) In project directory: Run `npm run dev`.
